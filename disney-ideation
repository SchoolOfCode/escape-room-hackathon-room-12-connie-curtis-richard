What is possible.
Multiple puzzles, each gives you a letter/digit as output
You use that letter or digit to make a 5 character code.
Final puzzle – whatorder do they go into the final lock to escape? Maybe a riddle of words relating to what oyu had to do for each puzzle.
Would it be possible to have multiple “rooms/backgrounds”. i.e. click on something, it takes you to a separate puzzle where you have to do something.this would allow us more space to work in for each puzzle.
What puzzles can we do. Hidden object, have to move or click on things to find another thing, then we can use that, maybe one is just simply, click around until you find a letter somewhere.
Input some sort of code.
Maybe you could have a room where theres a picture on the wall of animals in an order. And buttons oyu ca interact with that make sounds relating to those animals. Press buttons in correct order and get the code.

Haunted Mansion?
Dungeon


So central room has a single puzzle that is very simple so this can be the MVP if needed.

Engineers Room?

We decided on Huanted House theme - 
User starts in central room and must find an object to let them into the other room. This is the MVP. Possibly just an obvious button that opens all three doors to the other rooms. When pressed, a ghost appears that says he's going get them in a certain time.
User progresses into the other rooms as they please.
Each room has a simple puzzle where the reward for solving it is a unique key.
User must return to central room with all three keys - one from each room to escape the game.
