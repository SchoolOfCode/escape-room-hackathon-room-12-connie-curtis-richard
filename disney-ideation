What is possible.
Multiple puzzles, each gives you a letter/digit as output
You use that letter or digit to make a 5 character code.
Final puzzle – whatorder do they go into the final lock to escape? Maybe a riddle of words relating to what oyu had to do for each puzzle.
Would it be possible to have multiple “rooms/backgrounds”. i.e. click on something, it takes you to a separate puzzle where you have to do something.this would allow us more space to work in for each puzzle.
What puzzles can we do. Hidden object, have to move or click on things to find another thing, then we can use that, maybe one is just simply, click around until you find a letter somewhere.
Input some sort of code.
Maybe you could have a room where theres a picture on the wall of animals in an order. And buttons oyu ca interact with that make sounds relating to those animals. Press buttons in correct order and get the code.

So central room has a single puzzle that is very simple so this can be the MVP if needed.
